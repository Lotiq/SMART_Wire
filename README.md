<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Shape Memory Alloy Resistance Tracking library for Arduino, which currently uses DPM8600 series power converter to activate NiTi-based wires. This library was made for individuals without strong technical background or experience in Shape Memory materials. The system is made to be versatile and straightforward enough to accomadate many of hobbyists' projects.

### Vision

This library is used for quick and easy prototypes for those who are generally unfamiliar with how to work with NiTi-based alloys and how to activate them electronically. This project also serves an educational purpose to make Shape Memory Wires more commonly used among electronics beginners, as well as place to collect information about such wires, including Nitinol, Flexinol and BioMetal and other. 

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To get started you need to have the equipment and libraries described below.

### Prerequisites

* Requires DPM8605, DPM8608 or any other DPM8600 series **TTL** (not RS-485) power converter.
* [DPM_8600 power converter](https://github.com/Lotiq/DPM_8600) library to be installed.

### Installation

1. Clone or Download the repo
    - If downloaded, open the compressed file into a folder
2. Insert the folder into the main Arduino/libraries folder
3. Add DPM_8600 and SMART_Wire libraries into your project

<!-- ### Quick Setup

Here I want to link a video of a 5 min setup. -->


## Usage

Using Shape Memory wires could be very easy if you are familiar with both fabrication and library tools. Links below collect and summarise important information in a few 

* Full documentation of the library's functions
* Fabrication tutorials and tips & tricks
* Useful information on NiTi-based alloys and what to know before you buy
